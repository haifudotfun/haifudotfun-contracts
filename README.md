### **How It Works**

0. **Haifu**
   * Haifu is the automated or coordinated strategy by AI or human to operate your crypto. The profit or loss after operation is distributed pro-rata to its haifu token.
1. **Fundraising**  
   * The protocol starts with an Haifu token as a pool funded by either whitelisted depositors or $HAIFU token holders.  
   * Early backers receive Haifu token, aligning their incentives with the Haifu's growth.  
2. **Operation**  
   * Haifu is operated in a way where it can generate benefits. This includes automating a stablecoin operations by liquidating CDP positions, liquidating bad debts, trading in arbitrage, etc.
3. **Redeptions**
    * After fund expires, all operated funds are converted into $HAIFU on CLOB, and backers can claim back their profit or loss from Haifu via claiming with their haifu token to get $HAIFU.
